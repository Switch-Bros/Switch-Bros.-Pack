  "details": "Adjust the color of the screen of your Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nFeatures:\\nCreates a layer which color you can adjust.\\nPreset values for color temperature (f.lux/redshift-like).\\nControl screen brightness.\\nSave dusk/dawn times & screen brightness, and apply settings automatically.\\n\\nHow to use\\nTemperature/color:\\nUse the temperature slider to select the desired shading.\\nYou can override the color by using the RGBA sliders.\\nThe \"Alpha\" value controls the opacity of the layer.\\nDue to the way Fizeau works, it is sadly not possible to directly modify the screen color. Instead, it creates a transparent layer and applies color to it. However, this can lead to an overall increase of luminosity, especially visible with dark colors.\\nAdditionally, the layer is not visible in screenshots/recordings.\\nBrightness:\\nUse the brightness slider to set the desired screen brightness.\\nThis is not redundant with the built-in setting, as the value will be set at dusk time.\\nDawn/dusk:\\nWhen set, Fizeau will start at the \"dusk\" hour and shutdown at the \"dawn\" hour.\\nYou can override this by using the checkbox. Fizeau will then stay in the specified state.\\nSettings:\\nSettings are saved at /switch/Fizeau/config.ini, which you can also edit.\\nTo reduce the memory usage of the sysmodule, settings are not read continually. Instead, they are applied on application launch.\\nThus, you will need to launch the client after a reboot to restart Fizeau.",
  "changelog": "2.4.2\\n\\nFixes a race condition resulting in system crashes upon sleep mode transitions, or situations where the color correction would stop being applied automatically.\\n\\n2.4.1\\n\\nBump libtesla for 16.0\\n\\n2.4.0\\n\\nBacklight control is disabled and will do nothing on 14.0+\\n\\n2.3.0\\n\\nBump version\\n\\n2.2.3\\n\\nUpdate for AMS 1.2.1\\n\\n2.2.2\\n\\nUpdate for latest FW\\n\\n2.1.9\\n\\ncloses #34\\n\\n2.1.8\\n\\nBump versions for latest FW/AMS\\n\\n2.1.7\\n\\nBump version\\n\\n2.1.6\\n\\nUpdate for latest AMS\\n\\n2.1.5\\n\\nUpdate for 12.0.0\\n\\n2.1.4\\n\\nFixed a crash on FW <11.0\\nFixed a crash on lite consoles\\n\\n2.1.3\\n\\nUpdate for AMS v0.18\\n\\n2.1.2\\n\\nUpdate for 11.0.1\\n\\n2.1.1\\n\\nUpdate for 11.0.0\\n\\n2.1.0\\n\\nAdded optional chainloader to autostart the filter. If you'd like to have it, install the Fizeau-chl.zip instead. Don't forget to remove /atmosphere/contents/0100000000000F12/flags/boot2.flag if present!\\nAdded dimming with a configurable timeout (9.0.0+)\\nAdded an option to enable blue (> 6500K) temperatures\\n\\n2.0.1\\n\\nAdded a way to reset values in the overlay by pressing Y\\n\\n2.0.0\\n\\nThis version is a pretty much complete rewrite that uses a better way of modifying colors (more detail on this can be found in the readme). This fixes the issue previous versions had, where dark colors were made more luminous, as well as makes it possible to introduce new options:\\n\\nColor filtering: displays colors in nuances of a single component (red, green or blue)\\nGamma setting: ~contrast\\nLuminance setting: can be used to reduce the brightness of the screen further\\nSmooth transitions\\nIn addition, this removes the reliance on a layer, so that a Tesla overlay can be used to control these settings.\\nOptions have been reworked under \"profiles\", a collection of settings that can be applied independently to the external and internal display (docked and handheld, respectively), or both. Thus you can have different profiles adapted to certain games, or certain screens.\\n\\nAll firmwares are expected working.\\n\\n1.4.1\\n\\nUpdate libstratosphere\\n\\n1.4.0\\n\\nBump Version\\n\\n1.3.1\\n\\nUpdated for 10.x support\\n\\n1.3.0\\n\\nVersion Bump\\n\\n1.2.0\\n\\nFixed compatibility with tesla overlays\\nAdded toolbox.json for use with KosmosToolbox\\nReduced sysmodule heap usage\\n\\n1.1.1\\n\\nMassive improvement to sysmodule memory usage (nsp down 79% of previous size)\\nMade time sliders easier to control\\n\\n1.1.0\\n\\nAdded screen brightness control.\\n\\nThis value will be saved and applied at dusk time.\\nAdded notice when layer is overridden."
