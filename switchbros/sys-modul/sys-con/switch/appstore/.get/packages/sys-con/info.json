  "details": "A Nintedo Switch sysmodule for third-party controller support. No man-in-the-middle required!\\n\\n[Switch FW 5.0.0+]\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nThis sysmodule aims to provide complete functionality for most popular game controllers not supported by Nintendo Switch. At the current moment, only USB connection is supported.\\n\\nEnable in Kosmos Toolbox or reboot your console after installation.",
  "changelog": "0.6.4\\n\\nUpdated for FW 13.0.0\\n\\n0.6.3\\n\\nRecompiled for compatibility with FW 12.0.0\\n\\n0.6.2\\n\\nReduced FS sessions used by the sysmodule from 3 to 1\\nThis might have caused FS to run out of sessions and crash the system if you had too many sysmodules enabled.\\nReduced time sessions used by the sysmodule to 0\\nAgain to prevent time services to run out of sessions. Time was only used by logs anyway. They use system tick-based time now.\\n\\n0.6.1\\n\\nFixed an issue that caused version 0.6.0 to always use 100% of CPU core 3\\nThe sysmodule will now detect both versions of Dualshock 4 controllers at the same time (thanks @p-sam again)\\nAs such, the config option for it has been removed\\nChanged how controller configs work:\\nAdded separate options for both Left trigger deadzone and Right trigger deadzone.\\nController key mapping now supports multimapping, aka mapping multiple keys to the same button.\\nAdditionally, you can also disable a key entirely, by writing KEY_* = NONE.\\nPreviously, a line key_SYNC = LSTICK_CLICK would make the Sync/Capture button press the Left stick button, and make the Left stick button press the Capture button.\\nThis has been changed, so that this would only modify the Sync/Capture button. The Left stick button would still press the left stick button.\\nThe syntax has also been changed to KEY_CAPTURE = LSTICK_CLICK.\\n\\n0.6.0\\n\\nThis is a temporary release that i'm pressured to publish due to all the underlying issues that are still present on earlier versions. The \"actual\" 0.6.0 release will come at a later point.\\n\\nChangelog\\nThe sysmodule codebase has been rewritten to use libstratosphere.\\nThis will make it easier in the future to allow other homebrew to directly communicate with sys-con.\\nThe code now also looks a little bit cleaner :)\\nFixed an issue introduced by v0.5.2 causing the system to completely freeze when left in sleep mode with a controller plugged in.\\nFixed an issue introduced by v0.5.2 causing sys-con to not recognize more than 2-3 controllers simultaneously.\\n(Hopefully) fixed an issue causing controllers to be no longer recognized until sys-con is restarted.\\nThis was caused by sys-con randomly losing the USB handle, rendering the USB side of sys-con completely useless.\\n(Hopefully) fixed an issue causing the system to freeze when a controller is disconnected.\\nThe sysmodule will now delete the previous log file if it's too large (about ~130KB) on startup.\\nNote: This is the last release of sys-con that can still be enabled and disabled directly through Kosmos Toolbox without rebooting the console. All later versions will require a reboot.\\n\\n0.5.3\\n\\nFixed the maximum and minimum stick values generated by sys-con.\\nThis caused games like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Resident Evil 4 to crash when that stick value has been reached.\\nWhen using the mode that swaps left stick with d-pad, the stick values generated by d-pad are now clamped to a circle radius.\\nIf you have the latest version of Kosmos Toolbox, you can now manually enable/disable sys-con right from the toolbox menu without having to reboot your console. Hurray.\\n\\n0.5.2\\n\\nNothing much has changed, just updating this for the new Atmosphere 0.10 release.\\n\\nThere is a known issue on all versions of sys-con regarding Xbox One controllers. if you update your Xbox One controller to the latest firmware, it stops working properly. Since you can't downgrade the firmware, I suggest you don't update your Xbox One controllers until a fix has been found.\\n\\n0.5.1\\n\\nFixed multiple controllers being disconnected when disconnecting any controller\\nFixed the sysmodule crashing during sleep mode or eventually stopping recognizing controllers\\nFixed Dualshock 3 getting chaotic inputs when Dualshock 4 is connected\\nAdded an option to change the LED color of Dualshock 4 in config_dualshock4.ini: color_led. Optionally, if you want to turn LED off, set the color values to 0, 0, 0.\\n\\n0.5.0\\n\\nAdded support for Dualshock 4.\\nNOTE: Due to firmware limitations, only one generation of Dualshock 4 can be recognized at a time. If you have a Dualshock 4 model \"CUH-ZCT2E\", you need to go to sdmc:/config/sys-con/config_global.ini and change the value of use_dualshock_2nd_generation to true.\\nBonus feature: You can now customize controller colors! Head over to sdmc:/config/sys-con/ and modify the color values for each type of controller. Most controllers already have customized colors in place.\\n\\n0.4.2\\n\\nFixed some Xbox One controllers being recognized, but not receiving any input. Let me know if this release breaks your controller.\\nFixed original Xbox controllers not having correct input mapping\\n\\n0.4.0\\n\\nThe sysmodule now detects generic XInput devices. I can't promise every single XInput device will work, I can only hope your controller manufacturer follows the XInput protocol to the dot.\\n\\nXbox 360 Wireless Receiver is partially supported! When I say partially, it means that the LED is still blinking and the app doesn't seem to detect controllers disconnect. However, it has full button support and allows to connect up to 4 controllers at once. The config for it is the same as the Xbox 360 Wired.\\n\\n0.3.0\\n\\nThere is now a config folder for the sysmodule! You can find it at sdmc:/config/sys-con/ and modify the stick/trigger deadzones and remap inputs. All the config changes are updated in real time.\\nThe log file has also been moved to the config folder.\\nFixed an issue with some of the Microsoft Xbox controllers not connecting properly.\\nXbox 360 and Dualshock 3 LEDs now no longer blink.\\n\\n0.2.3.1\\n\\nThe 0.2.3 version had improper naming\\n\\n0.2.3\\n\\nHalves the memory used by the sysmodule.\\n[9.0.0+] If you're having freezes or crashes (error 2003-0008) when launching a game, try disabling other memory-intensive sysmodules (sys-ftpd, emuiibo). Or downgrade to 8.0.0."
