  "details": "This is a nintendo-switch sysmodule which runs an ftpd-server in the background (on port 5000 with no auth).\\n\\nThe ftpd is basically copy paste from this ftpd-fork.\\n\\nPut the contents of the sd_card folder in the root of your sd-card or else the sound effects won't work!\\n\\nHotkeys: To help with security while there is are no login credentials, debugging, or otherwise, you can toggle the state of the server using the (+) + (-) + (X) button combination.\\n\\nSound effects from: https://freesound.org/people/jens.enk/sounds/434610/\\nhttps://freesound.org/people/jens.enk/sounds/434611/\\nhttps://freesound.org/people/rhodesmas/sounds/322897/ https://freesound.org/people/rhodesmas/sounds/322895/\\n\\n",
  "changelog": "1.0.4\\n\\nAnonymous login is now disabled by default\\nUser credentials are now empty by default\\nThe server will now reject any connections until both the user and password fields are set.\\nThis update might annoy some people who get their configs overriden by downloader apps like hbstore.\\nIt is released in response to claims of people getting their consoles hacked through local networks created through ldn_mitm.\\n\\n1.0.3\\n\\nReduced FS sessions used by the sysmodule from 3 to 1\\nThis might have caused FS to run out of sessions and crash the system if you had too many sysmodules enabled.\\nFixed LED lights staying enabled permanently on controllers with old firmware.\\nLED now only lights up for the main player only.\\nWhen pressing the pause button combo to pause the server, the LED will light up in a \"double click\" pattern.\\nWhen doing the same to unpause the server, the LED will light up in a single long \"resume\" pattern.\\nThis is to make up for the fact that there was no indication if the server gets actually paused or not.\\nChanged the response format for PASV command for compatibility with some FTP clients.\\n\\n1.0.2\\n\\nMultiple config options have been added:\\nThe key combination to pause the ftpd server can now be changed.
