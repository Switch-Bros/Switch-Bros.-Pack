  "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed.\\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.",
  "changelog": "1.6.8\\n\\nList of changes:\\n\\nIntroduction of ini_file_source function and expansion of ini_file function.\\nDropdown selections can now use ini_file_source <PATH_TO_INI> which will return a list of ini section name.\\nIntroduction of new placeholder index replacements selections{ini_file(<INDEX>)} / {ini_file_source(*)} for returning section names. (regular usage of ini_file placeholder calls will still function the same way, as well as ini_file_source)\\nNamed step-trackbars can now use standard json_source, json_file_source, and ini_file_source source functions and placeholder replacements.\\nExpansion of filter to non-path type entries in dropdown selections.\\nCalled filter <NAME_OF_ENTRY>.\\nExpansion of exit command to exit directly to the overlays menu or packages menu.\\nCalled exit overlays / exit packages.\\nExpansion of refresh command.\\nrefresh theme: reload/refresh the current current loaded theme (/config/ultrahand/theme.ini)\\nrefresh package: reload/refresh the current working package (redraws menu)\\nIntroduction of compare function to compare two text file lists and output a duplicate files list.\\nCalled compare <PATH_TO_TXT_1> <PATH_TO_TXT_2> <OUTPUT_TXT_PATH>.\\nNew option -copy_filter / -cp_filter for move / mv commands utilizing -src + -dest.\\nCalled move -src <SRC_TXT> -dest <DEST_TXT> -copy_filter <FILTER_TXT>.\\nThis will run a copy instead of move for files in the filter list text file.\\nIntroduction of new placeholder function split for splitting strings.\\nCalled {split(<STRING>,<PATTERN>,<INDEX>)}.\\nFor example, if the string is Test - String, the pattern is \" - \", and the index is 0, the output would be Test.\\nUpdates to the pre-generated /switch/.packages/package.ini root package file to include Reboot To (for booting directly into /bootloader/hekate_ipl.ini boot entries.\\nNotice: Users may need to delete /switch/.packages/package.ini for it to generate a new one.\\nVarious optimizations to the command interpreter, file manipulation logging, bulk execution implementations, and to move / mv operations.\\nAdditional tweaks to the dangerous pattern detection function.\\nUpdate to Mod Alchemist now at v0.4.7.\\nBug fixes for toggling content mods with duplicate files (utilizing -copy_filter and compare).\\n\\n1.6.7\\n\\nList of changes:\\n\\nNew optional command parameters for copy/cp, move/mv, and delete/del commands for transfer logging and bulk executions.\\n\\na. File manipulation logging: -log_src / -log_dest (outputs a text list for source file and destination file locations)\\n\\ncopy <source_file_path> <destination_file_path> -log_src <src_output_txt_file_path> -log_dest <dest_output_txt_file_path>\\nmove <source_file_path> <destination_file_path> -log_src <src_output_txt_file_path> -log_dest <dest_output_txt_file_path>\\ndelete <source_file_path> -log_src <src_output_txt_file_path>\\nb. Bulk execution: -src / -dest (utilizes text lists to perform transfer operations on all entries)\\n\\ncopy -src <src_input_txt_file_path> -dest <dest_input_txt_file_path>\\nmove -src <src_input_txt_file_path> -dest <dest_input_txt_file_path>\\ndelete -src <src_input_txt_file_path>\\nImprovements and fixes to file_source toggle functions.\\n\\nImproved handling of null placeholder replacements.\\n\\nCorrections to isDangerousCombination (the dangerous pattern combination detection function).\\n\\nThe following paths are now ultra-protected (unable to delete or move files from):\\nsdmc:/Nintendo/Contents/\\nsdmc:/Nintendo/save/\\nsdmc:/emuMMC/RAW1/Nintendo/Contents/\\nsdmc:/emuMMC/RAW1/Nintendo/save/\\nSlight improvements to dangerous pattern detection.\\nUpdates to Mod Alchemist (now v0.4.6, requires Ultrahand v1.6.7+).\\n\\nNow utilizes the new command options for managing \"Contents\" mods.\\n\\n1.6.6\\n\\nStability update.\\n\\nList of changes:\\n\\nMajor memory leak has been fixed.\\nThis issue was present for a while now, but until Mod Alchemist was never as concerning. Since Mod Alchemist can draw extremely long menus, memory overflow problems became more apparent.\\nHas been resolved and should result in better memory handling across all Ultrahand packages/commands.\\nSlight tweaks to the displayed version label formatting for overlays and packages.\\nFailed interpreter spawning bug fix.\\nCommands would occasionally get locked in an \"in-progress\" mode when there were memory related problems when trying to spawn the interpreter thread. When memory related problems occur, the command will return a failed command state instead (red \"X\").\\n\\n1.6.5\\n\\nIntroduction of root-layer boot package implementation for executing commands upon startup.\\nCommand [boot] located within /switch/.packages/boot_package.ini (if it exists) will be now be auto-ran once on startup.\\nThis feature can be useful for Switch Android users if they wanted to remove the auto-generated Android folders (for instance).\\nIntroduction of new command pchtxt2cheat (called pchtxt2cheat /path/to/file.pchtxt).\\nThis function will convert pchtxt files and load them into the correct directory for the game's cheat.\\nImportant: The game's title ID must be present somewhere within the pchtxt for this function to work.\\nVarious bug fixes to pchtxt2ips's IPS generation.\\nExpansion of shutdown command to turn off all bluetooth controllers.\\nThis function is called shutdown controllers.\\nNotice: I have heard that this command may fail (return a red X) with MissionControl due to conflicting services, so just a heads up.\\nSource function file_source can now be chained (called one after another) for combining multiple sources into a single list.\\nSource function definitions can now also utilize an ini_file placeholder replacement (with the ini_file specified before the definition).\\nVarious bug fixes to file_source toggles.\\nSubsequent clicks to file_source toggles are now handled properly with alternating path replacements according to the last line move {file_source} /destination/path/ (must be present for file_source toggles).\\nVarious bug fixes to ini_file placeholder replacements.\\nFailed replacements now return null again instead of Not available (the UNAVAILABLE_SELECTION language variable).\\nWhen a value is null on a table info section, it is now auto replaced with UNAVAILABLE_SELECTION.\\nLanguage selections in the Settings Menu now state their full names in their translated language with their abbreviations listed as footers.\\nThis included updates to all /config/ultrahand/lang/ files.\\nAdditional key combo LS+RS has been added to the combos list.\\nThis includes a correction to the LS button icon.\\nCommands mirror_copy and mirror_delete can now accept wildcard patterns.\\nIntroduction of new Ultrahand Package Mod Alchemist designed for managing, converting, and installing game mods.

(touching \"OK\" on top of a track-bar, bottom regions for touch adjusted to language text size, etc.)\\nSlight tweaks to pixel blender for drawn strings during hiding."
