  "description": "Generates all Amiibos on your Switch",
  "details": "Generates all Amiibos directly on your console.\\n\\nIt needs internet to download the amiibo database from. Though you can download it manually and place it in sdmc:/emuiibo/amiibos.json. (Go to Github repository to see links)\\n\\nThe homebrew does not generate amiibo.bin dumps and does not contain anything stolen from nintendo. It only generates json files that emuiibo can use. They are exactly the same ones than the ones generated by emutool.",
  "changelog": "1.4.0\\n\\nFixed an issue where custom created amiibos were deleted.\\nAmiiboGenerator will create an \"autogenerated.flag\" file inside the amiibo folder and only delete amiibos with that flag file.\\nIf you want to keep an autogenerated amiibo, remove that file\\nBecause all amiibos will be deleted before generating new ones, if you create a folder structure that the tool wants to use too, it will skip generating/overwriting the files. Very unlikely but better safe than sorry.\\nFixed an issue with an Animal Crossing Amiibo where the slash in its name would create an unexpected folder structure.\\nDue to the new update, you might need to manually delete the amiibos, as they lack the \"autogenerated.flag\" file and wont be deleted or overwritten by the new version of the tool. You could delete all amiibos with 1.3.0, update and then generate them again.\\n\\nThis release shows as 1.3.0 on your switch.\\n\\n1.2.0\\n\\nDownloaded Amiibo images will now be auto resized to a height of 150px (and width in aspect ratio). This will help with the fluidity inside the overlay and reduce overall filesize.\\nDownloaded Amiibo images without an alpha-channel will be converted to RGBA, to be able to display correctly in the overlay.\\n\\n1.1.0\\n\\nAdded the option to download amiibo images (very slow) and redid the \"menu\"."
