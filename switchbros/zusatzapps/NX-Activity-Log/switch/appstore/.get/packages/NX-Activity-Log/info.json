  "details": "NX Activity Log is a homebrew application for the Nintendo Switch which displays more accurate information about your play activity. The UI has been designed to feel familiar and is navigated in a similar manner to the Switch's firmware.\\n\\nIt currently includes the following features:\\n- All Time Activity\\n    - Total Playtime in minutes\\n    - Number of times a game has been launched\\n    - Date of first launch\\n    - Date/time of most recent launch\\n    - Average time spent in a game\\n    - Sorting games by time played, recently played, etc.\\n- Recent Activity (see note below)\\n    - View by day, month or year\\n    - Total playtime in seconds\\n    - Number of launches\\n    - Sorted by most played\\n- Miscellaneous\\n    - Automatic theme detection to match the Switch's colour scheme\\n    - Ability to override User Page\\n\\nNote: The data shown in Recent Activity may be slightly inaccurate over larger periods of time (ie. off by a few minutes) but I will try to improve this over time. If activity is not being shown for earlier periods of time it is likely your switch has been reset at some point, which wipes the data used to calculate playtime in this way.",
