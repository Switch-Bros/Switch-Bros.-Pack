  "details": "Amiigo is a GUI for Emuiibo and a EmuGUIibo alternative that runs directly on the switch.\\n\\nControls\\nUp / Down on Dpad to move up and down the list.\\n\\nA to select a Amiibo from the list.\\n\\nX toggles emulation state.\\n\\nY moves on to the next Amiibo.\\n\\nB enters the Amiigo Maker. Press B again to go back to the Amiibo selection UI.\\n\\nYou can also use the touch screen to select an Amiibo by tapping on a item in the list, tapping the emulation status rectangle will toggle the emulation state, and tapping the currently selected Amiibo on the top rectangle will move on to the next Amiibo.\\n\\n",
  "changelog": "2.3.1\\n\\nAmiigo will now validate that the local API cache is valid before using it, this prevents Amiigo crashing at startup if connection was lost during first setup\\nFixed bug where function pointer was used as input to an if statement instead of the function's output during deinit. This function will likely never return false anyway\\n\\n2.2.0\\n\\nAdded extra category\\nUpdated Arriba\\nFixed minor bug in API caching code\\nCheck for the presence of /Atmosphere/contents when installing Emuiibo\\nChanged how Amiibos are categorized when making new Amiibos\\n\\n2.1.0\\n\\nUpdate manually, updating through Amiigo 2.0's built in updater will cause you to crash due to a bug\\n\\nChanges to Amiigo\\n- Fixed bug that would cause the console to fatal when updating through Amiigo\\n- Updated Arriba\\n- Added support for loading custom background shaders\\n- Automatically use outdated API cache if no internet connection within 5 seconds of first time setup\\n\\nChanges to Arriba\\n- Arriba will output the correct screen size when the console is docked / undocked\\n- Arriba now renders text in to a framebuffer to improve performance\\n- Fixed some text characters being incorrectly positioned\\n\\n2.0.0\\n\\nAmiigo was rewritten from scratch.\\nAmiigo will now automatically install the latest version of Emuiibo when launched for the first time if Emuiibo is not present.\\nAmiigo now uses a custom OpenGL based UI library called Arriba, note that I wrote Arriba so it's very bad and no one else should use it for their homebrew.\\nThanks to Arriba Amiigo now has much better touch support. The Amiibo lists now have inertia so you can scroll them like a phone menu, please mess with this it was hard to implement and probably not worth the time it took.\\nThe \"Check for updates\" button was replaced with a settings tab which has the options to switch between category modes, update the API cache, and update to the latest version of Amiigo when an update is detected.\\nAmiigo will now no longer update the API cache every time you open Amiigo Maker.\\nAmiigo should (hopefully) be idiot proof now. If you're unable to use it it has probably broken again and I haven't had time to update it.\\nSorry that this update took almost 2 years to release, I know that Amiigo has been broken for a long time but my console broke so I was unable to update it and a bunch of other stuff happened by the time I got a new one. I would tell you about it but I already sold exclusive rights for the story to Wololo in exchange for a pizza.\\n\\n1.6.0\\n\\nAmiigo now has images for Amiibos thanks to @Kronos2308\\nI added my file sort code that I wrote for N-Xplorer so now the Amiibos are sorted by their name.\\nExperimental support was added for theming by @Kronos2308 . This slows down the GUI a bit but I hope to speed this up for the next release.\\nI also created a discord server for my projects. You can join here: https://discord.gg/ZhRn3nn\\n\\n1.5.3\\n\\nThis version adds in a check for when Emuiibo isn't running (thank you to @Kronos2308 ), Changes the colors of the UI (this was done by me and @Kronos2308 ), and I also improved the updater code so that it no longer assumes Amiigo is in the /switch/ directory which makes updating better for people who downloaded Amiigo through 4tu's HB App Store and CFW packs.\\n\\n1.5.2\\nThis update uses the new 0.4.0 Emuiibo ipc and uses libnx 3.0.0. It should be functionally identical to 1.5.1.\\n\\n1.5.1\\n\\nWith this release when creating new virtual Amiibos using Amiigo Maker the new virtual Amiibo will be created in whatever folder the main UI is currently in.\\nThe main UI's header will now only display the virtual Amiibo's name instead of it's path.\\nEmuiibo is now properly exited when closing the app which previously caused Emuiibo to stop working when Amiigo was opened too many times.\\n\\n\\n\\n1.5.0\\n\\nThis release adds experimental support for categories and other minor changes.\\nTo use categories create a new folder in your Amiibo folder and put virtual Amiibos in it. Press A in Amiigo to enter the sub-folder and B to exit it.\\n\\n1.4.4\\n\\nThis release adds a temporary method to delete Amiibos. This can be done by pressing in on the left stick like a button. My original plan was to add an Amiibo Manager menu which would allow for deleting and renaming Amiibos but I have been busier than I anticipated lately so I haven't had time to implement it properly.\\n\\n1.4.3\\n\\nFixed bug that made the updater always fail\\n\\n1.4.2\\n\\nIn this release I added a check in the updater code to prevent fataling when Github API rate limiting is in effect. I also made changes to Amiigo Maker so if the AmiiboAPI goes down again it will load the offline version instead of crashing.\\n\\n1.4.1\\n\\nAmiibo API is down and if you try to connect to it it will overwrite the offline data with invalid data. This release will crash before that happens. I'll release a better fix soon.\\n\\n1.4.0\\n\\nThis release adds the ability to update Amiigo from within Amiigo and adds a slightly nicer UI (Thank you to shchmue for the border suggestion).\\n\\n1.3.1\\n\\nThis update fixes a crash caused when no Amiibos are available to Emuiibo and Amiigo tries to show their path in the header. Big thank you to Slluxx for both telling me about this bug and theorizing what caused it to happen."
