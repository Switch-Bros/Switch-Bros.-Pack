  "details": "This release is taken from here : https://gbatemp.net/threads/melonds-for-switch.518300/page-35#post-8830041\\n\\nmelonDS\\nDS emulator, sorta\\n\\nThe goal is to do things right and fast, akin to blargSNES (but hopefully better). But also to, you know, have a fun challenge :)\\n\\nThe source code is provided under the GPLv3 license.\\n\\nHow to use\\nmelonDS requires BIOS/firmware copies from a DS. Files required:\\n\\nbios7.bin, 16KB: ARM7 BIOS\\nbios9.bin, 4KB: ARM9 BIOS\\nfirmware.bin, 128/256/512KB: firmware\\nFirmware boot requires a firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite. DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.\\n\\nPossible firmware sizes\\n128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)\\n256KB: regular DS firmware\\n512KB: iQue DS firmware\\nDS BIOS dumps from a 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps should be usable too, provided they were dumped properly.\\n\\nAs for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!",

Others will run much faster than they did before. Be warned that maximum overclock will probably heat up your Switch more than normal and extensive use might negatively affect your system.\\n\\nv0.4\\n\\n-Added screen rotation and screen layout settings; functionality is identical to desktop melonDS\\n-The emulation window is now drawn with OpenGL\\n-Having Vsync on is now just as fast as having it off\\n-Vsync option has been removed\\n\\nNOTE: Don't get too excited by the OpenGL! I'm only using it to draw the software renderer's output to the screen. There is NO speed boost from this right now. Yes, there is a bit of a speed boost in this build, but it has little to do with OpenGL.\\n\\nv0.3.1\\nFix sound output\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nmelonDS was just bumped to version 0.7 a few hours ago, so here's another release from me as well! This release comes with an options menu containing four whole options (crazy, I know). I've also reworked some things to prevent flickering when navigating the menus.\\n\\nThe options added include:\\nBoot game directly - Disabling this will allow you to boot into the DS firmware instead of automatically running a game.\\nThreaded 3D renderer - Speeds up 3D rendering; you probably don't want to turn this off.\\nVsync - While not technically being Vsync, the functionality is similar enough. Disabling this will let the screen render without waiting for a frame to finish. It'll give you a performance increase at the cost of screen tearing and minor artifacts.\\nAudio output - Self-explanatory. Disable to sacrifice audio for a small performance boost.\\n\\nThe first two options are actual melonDS options, while the last two are custom ones I added for the purpose of increasing performance. You still probably won't get full speed, and the trade-offs may or may not be worth it, but at least it's something.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nThis release features the latest commits from upstream melonDS, which mainly feature the addition of experimental savestates. To use savestates on the Switch port, press L to save and R to load. You only get one slot per game. This is only temporary until I make some sort of actual menu system. Note that the DS L and R buttons are mapped to the Switch ZL and ZR buttons; don't get them mixed up!"
