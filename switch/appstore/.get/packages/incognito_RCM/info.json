There is not much of error handling going on.\\n\\nUsage\\nLaunch Incoginito_RCM.bin using your favorite payload injector\\nUse menu to make a backup! (Will be written to sd:/prodinfo_sysnand.bin and sd:/prodinfo_emunand.bin respectively)\\nChoose either Incognito (sysNAND) or Incognito (emuMMC) to wipe personal information\\nIf you ever want to revert, choose restore menu points\\nKeep in mind that backups will be overwritten, so don't backup after applying Incognito!",
