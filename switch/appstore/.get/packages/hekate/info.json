This change doesn't actually affect the user, it just reduces the codesize/complexity of hekate. Also it has nothing to do with actual fuses burnt.)\\nSimplified RAM OC for users that compile an overclocked Minerva library.\\nMany bugfixes\\n\\n5.5.1\\n\\nHOS 11.0.1 support\\nFix sleep in modchipped Eristas\\nFirst BCT, that is used in warmboot binary, has improper modulus.

For now this can only patch KIPs defined in hekate's code, with whatever new patches. Next versions will support other KIPs.\\nMany bugfixes\\n\\nNyx v0.8.0\\n\\nSnappy and fluid GUI w/ touch support\\nYes! This runs on BPMP!\\nAll classic launch options are there\\nemuMMC manage\\nChange between raw partition emuMMCs and SD file based ones easily.\\nCreate file based or raw partition based from eMMC via the Create button.\\nYou can also restore a backup directly to sd partition via the Restore option in tools (outside of emuMMC), AFTER you turned ON SD emuMMC Raw Partition.\\nMigrate other types of emunand (raw partition or sd file), repair existing raw partition configurations, or migrate a backup (outside of restore folder), to sd file based.\\nEverything is currently made to protect Linux partitions.\\nAdditionally, the raw partition based is done in 16MB offset, so it can protected from quick formats.\\nAll Info and Tools are now supercharged\\nDump individual kips from eMMC, see detailed info about fuses, do backups and restores way faster, etc.\\nCustomization support\\nCustom icons for boot entries and also a background is supported.

For as long as rebuilding the boot process takes.\\nSmarter versioning for update.bin and sept payloads\\nNow it supports hotfix versions and it's still compatible with old hekate versions.\\nSept is now updated via hekate's copy in IRAM. This negates the mandatory usage of update.bin and it copies always the most updated version.\\nAdditionally if sept/payload.bin is found that it's foreign, it is renamed and hekate takes its place for running sept. After that it renames the original payload back and continues with booting.\\ndebugmode is now obsolete for atmosphere. It's enabled by default.\\nSome nasty stack corruption bugs were fixed\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom warmboot binary to boot 7.X.X.\\n\\nv4.8\\n\\nFull 7.0.0/7.0.1 support.\\nThe keys are generated via Atmosphère's sept.\\nAdditionally the sept/payload.bin, if found that it is hekate, it gets updated via update.bin.\\nReboot to a selected boot entry via HOS hb\\nYou can now force a boot configuration on hekate by setting the boot storage in the hekate binary.\\nThis can be done via a homebrew, which sets the ini entry that is desired to boot.\\nAdditionally force boot to menu can also be achieved.
